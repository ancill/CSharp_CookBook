More Information: If you use a Linux variant that cannot create self- signed certificates or you do not mind reapplying for a new certificate every 90 days, then you can get a free certificate from the following link: https://letsencrypt.org

In TERMINAL, enter the dotnet dev-certs https --trust command, and note the message, Trusting the HTTPS development certificate was requested. You might be prompted to enter your password and a valid HTTPS certificate may already be present.
